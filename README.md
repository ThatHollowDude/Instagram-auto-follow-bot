# Instagram-auto-follow-bot
A python programm to automatically follow or unfollow a targeted id's followers or following.

REQUIREMENTS:
Python 3.11 & any python code editor.(Pycharm recommended)

HOW TO USE:
Open pycharm and create a new project, then copy and paste main.py and instafollwer.py to that project's directory.
Now run main.py.
Now put your instagram username(be carefull, don't make any mistakes)
put you instagram password(again be carefull and don't make any mistakes)
Type the targeted id as it is.(no mistakes here)

# Naming scheme of the inputs is a bit confusing so here's a quick guide about how to use them
#fs = targeted id's FOLLOWERS 
#fw = targeted id's FOLLOWING  
#fl = follow 
#ufl = unfollow

So for example if you choose fw and fl, then the code will get all the followings of the targeted id and follow them.
Or if you choose fw and ufl then the code will unfollow all the follwings of the targeted id.

NOTE: 
while using the code you must NOT be following the targeted id.
while using the ufl command the code will follow all the users that are not already followed.
